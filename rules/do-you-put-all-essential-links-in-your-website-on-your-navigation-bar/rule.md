<span class='intro'> <p>
                    There are certain links on a website which you want to make 
     VERY simple for users to find. I hate hunting around on a 
     site for a phone numbers. These are the basics which should 
     be easily accessible from every page&#58;
                </p><ul><li>Home page (top left corner)</li><li>Contact Us (with a phone number, not a form.submit!)</li><li>News (especially for journalists)</li><li>Directions (so prospects and clients can come and 
     visit!)</li></ul> </span>
