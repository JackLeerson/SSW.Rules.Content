<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​​When you've finished a PBI you should record a video to send to your product owner and anyone else that is interested. They can even double as release notes for your users.<br></p> </span>

<p>Here's a quick video describing how to record and edit&#160;a quick done video.</p>

<p>Notice how it itself is also in the done video format?<br></p><p>Here are the key things to remember&#58;</p><ul><li>Record in one take. It doesn't matter if you stuff up or something goes wrong, treat it like you're having a conversation with them in the room. If it's super bad, just start again.<br></li><li>When using your browser, remember to&#160; hide visible bookmark bars,&#160;browser tabs, add-in icons, and taskbar items to make it easier to view.<br></li><li>See Rule&#58;&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=d6c8ec14-f604-490a-a96a-82315794cd6b" target="_blank">Do you make sure your screen recordings are easy to view?</a><br></li><li>If you are using a browser such as Chrome then you should first zoom to 125% ideally.<br></li><li>See Rule&#58;&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=01b38f0f-597f-4410-84de-465a705aabea" target="_blank">Do you always zoom in when using a projector?</a>&#160;before the recording<br></li><li>Record at 1920x1080 (aka 1080p). This gives the best balance of detail to size, so it's readable on a mobile phone.<br></li><li>If you're using Camtasia Studio 9 don't edit the video, just include your face at the beginning and end, using the fading functionality.&#160;See&#160;instructions<span style="background-color&#58;initial;"> after the video&#160;below.</span></li><li>It's supposed to be quick and easy to make. If you spend too much time, you will be less likely to want to do it again in the future.</li><li>Be quick and concise, you don't want to waste other peoples'&#160;time either!<br></li></ul><p><strong>Tip&#58; </strong>You can either use Camtasia, SnagIt or Zoom for recording this.<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Let's look at an example by Ben Cull<br></h3><p>E.g.
