<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">I absolutely hate being put on hold. When I call someone up to buy something and I get put on hold so that they can pick up another call, it amazes me how they are willing to jeopardize a hot prospect for an anonymous phone call. I think that when you have the momentum of the conversation going, the last thing you should do is put someone on hold to answer another call.<br></p> </span>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​Of course, if you are the only one in the office, you should always pick up the other phone.​<br></p>
