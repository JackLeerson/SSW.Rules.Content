<span class='intro'> <p>If you've ever wondered why the formats of graphics on the web differ from each other, you're not alone. 
                With SVGs, PNGs, and JPGs, it's hard to know which format you should use in a particular situation. 
                Don't simply add any image that looks alright, it is very important to know the advantages and disadvantages of each format for optimization. </p> </span>
