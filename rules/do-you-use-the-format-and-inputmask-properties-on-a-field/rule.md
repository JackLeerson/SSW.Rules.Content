<span class='intro'> SQL Server and MSDE have no equivalent to the Format or InputMask property in Microsoft Access 2000. As a result, neither property will be upsized when it is encountered by the Upsizing Wizard, nor will any errors be reported in the Upsizing Report. All formatting displayed as a result of using the Format property will be lost when the data is migrated to SQL Server or MSDE.
