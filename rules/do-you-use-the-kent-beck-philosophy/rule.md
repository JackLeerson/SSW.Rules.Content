<span class='intro'> <p><span lang="EN-AU">Kent Beck is the man credited with &quot;rediscovering&quot; the Test Driven Development methodology.&#160; It's a great way to ensure your code works as expected and it will allow you to catch errors that occur down the track.</span></p> </span>

<p>Based on Kent Beck's principles, you should&#58; </p>
<ol><li>Write code as it spews out of your brain</li>
<li>Do lots of small refactoring rather than big architectural rewrites</li>
<li>If you are going to change code, add a test first (AKA red-green-refactor)</li></ol>
<p><strong>Tip&#58;</strong> Read Michael Feather’s book, <a href="http&#58;//www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052"><font color="#3a66cc">&quot;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&quot;</font></a> for some insights into effective unit testing.</p>
<p><strong>Tip&#58;</strong> Don't focus on the percentage of code coverage, focus on whether tests will touch the lines of code you care about​.</p>
