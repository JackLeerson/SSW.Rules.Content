<span class='intro'> <div>Don't use &quot;OK&quot; if the button does one clear action. The button name must reflect the action that is going to happen by clicking the button. Examples of button names that are better than &quot;OK&quot; are&#58;</div>
<ul><li>Save</li>
<li>Move</li>
<li>Rename</li>
<li>Open</li>
<li>Select</li>
<li>Insert</li>
<li>Print</li>
<li>Process</li>
<li>Login</li></ul>
 </span>

<dd>Figure&#58; Save button in action</dd></dl>
<div>However, there is an exception when there are multiple settings being changed. Typical examples are Properties and the Tools - Options dialog. There are often many tabs with many options. It would make no sense to have &quot;Save Settings&quot; or &quot;Save&quot;. This is where the &quot;OK&quot; &quot;Apply&quot; &quot;Cancel&quot; convention really applies.</div>
