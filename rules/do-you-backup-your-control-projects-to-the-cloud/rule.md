<span class='intro'> <p>​If your project gets corrupted or if the changes you made caused unexpected issues, do you have a backup of your Control4 project to rollback to?​<br></p> </span>

<p>​You should create a backup whenever you make a change to the project in Composer. Composer will prompt you to create a backup if you attempt to close it without doing so.&#160;<br></p><p>The updated backup should be checked in to version control. While it's a binary file and can't be merged or compared to other versions of the same file, it's good to have a copy to roll back to if a future update breaks something.&#160;​<br><br></p>
