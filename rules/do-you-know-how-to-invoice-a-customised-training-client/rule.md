<span class='intro'> <p>When you sell a training engagement you should invoice the client as soon as the training is confirmed by email, as training is always fixed price and the cost will not vary like a time and materials engagement.<br></p> </span>

<p>​​Sending an invoice before the training begins acts as a confirmation of the training and allows the invoice to be paid a little earlier than usual.<br><br></p>
