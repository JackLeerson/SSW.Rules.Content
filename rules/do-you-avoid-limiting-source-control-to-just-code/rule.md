<span class='intro'> This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). </span>

<ul>In particular, you should make it as easy as possible to see who changed what and who deleted what and allow a simple rollback to previous versions of non-code files. Files you should put in source control include&#58; <li>XSL files </li>
<li>Word documents </li>
<li>Excel Spreadsheets </li>
<li>Visio Diagrams </li>
<li>HTML files </li>
<li>Image files, Flash animations and psd files&#160; (yes this takes room in your source control database - but we still want to be able to revert to an old version easily) </li></ul>
<ul>Things you don't store are&#58; <li>Video files eg. avi </li>
<li>Installers eg. .msi </li></ul>
