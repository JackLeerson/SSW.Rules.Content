<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">When we're speaking on the phone and taking down notes on your computer live is just a hell of a lot easier when you've got both of your hands-free so you can type away as you please. There's a simple solution - use headsets. With these not only can you type furiously with both hands but they're supposed to be a lot more ergonomically friendly.<br></p> </span>

<p>USB headsets are preferred over direct audio input/output as they can be plugged into any machine and work without requiring drivers to be installed. Despite USB having a higher initial overhead than unplugging the audio&#160;line-ins/outs to get the equivalent of speaker mode, by conferencing calls you don't explicitly require people to gather in the one location, and the&#160;background noise&#160;is&#160;reduced.â€‹<br></p>
