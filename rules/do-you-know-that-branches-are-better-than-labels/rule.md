<span class='intro'> <p>TFS takes labeling to a new level unlike VSS which was a point in time label. TFS labels each file based on their changeset version. You can then get code as it was when you labeled the source. </p> </span>

<p>Labeling a release is a good way to go back to a version and generate a compiled version. If you wanted to develop an older version then you would create a branch instead (of course you can create a branch off a label) </p>
