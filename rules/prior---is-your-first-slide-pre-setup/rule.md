<span class='intro'> You may be a natural born public speaker, but you will not be able 'wing' a presentation. Setting up a presentation takes time and practice. You want web pages already open, you want VMs ready and demos good to go.
 </span>


  <p>So document the steps to undertake prior to starting and you will present in a snappier fashion and not need to say the lame statement &quot;hope the demo gods are kind to me today&quot;. </p>
