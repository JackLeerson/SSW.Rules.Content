<span class='intro'> 
  <p>Bad way&#58; use the Global Address List in Active Directory, because you canâ€™t update it from Outlook... Only an administrator can maintain the details<br>
Note&#58; good UI as it is easy to find inside outlook</p>
<p>Good way&#58; use the Dynamics 365 (formerly&#160;CRM 2016)&#160;toolbar?<br>
Note&#58; We have a suggestion that Outlook should allow you to put the CRM2016 URL into Tools | Options so this is better integrated</p>
